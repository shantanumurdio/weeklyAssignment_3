# White Board App

This is a simple web application that allows users to draw on a whiteboard using a canvas element. Users can choose the pen color, draw on the canvas, and clear the canvas when needed.

## Features

- Drawing: Users can draw on the canvas by clicking and dragging the mouse cursor.
- Pen Color: The default pen color is black, but it can be changed by modifying the `context.strokeStyle` property in the JavaScript code.
- Clear Canvas: The "Delete" button allows users to clear the entire canvas and start over.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. The canvas will occupy most of the visible screen area.
3. Click and drag the mouse cursor to draw on the canvas.
4. To change the pen color, you can modify the `context.strokeStyle` property in the `script.js` file.
5. Click the "Delete" button to clear the canvas.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that sets up the structure of the web page and includes the necessary JavaScript and CSS files.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that contains styling rules for the layout and appearance of the web page.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file responsible for handling user interactions and drawing on the canvas.

## Customization

You can customize the appearance and behavior of the whiteboard app by modifying the CSS and JavaScript code. For instance, you can adjust colors, sizes, and other visual elements according to your preferences.

Feel free to experiment with the code and enhance the application with additional features if desired.

## Notes

- This application is intended for educational and experimental purposes.
- Compatibility: The app should work on modern web browsers that support HTML5 canvas and JavaScript.
